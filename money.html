<h1>   &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>What is Money and How is it printed?</u></h1>

   <p>       &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Money is any medium of exchange that can be used to pay for goods and
services and to measure the value of things. Currency is a term for a country&#39;s
money in circulation—that is, coins and bills.
Before people used money, they bartered, or traded things they had for the things
they wanted.For example, a person may had traded five goats for one cow.
Bartering was not always simple, though. Each person had to agree that the items
being traded had an equal value. Also, each person had to have something that the
      other person wanted.</p>

        <p>       &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; People invented money to avoid bartering. Someone with five goats could exchange them for a certain amount of money instead of a cow. The person could then exchange that money for grain, cloth, or other goods of the same value. Today the metal coins and pieces of paper that people use for money have little real value. In other words, people do not use the paper for writing or the metal for making tools. The value of paper money and coins comes from an agreement between all people. They agree that they will accept certain forms of money in exchange for their goods and services. This agreement between people is the reason money works.</p>

        <br>
        <p>       &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The first types of paper money were used in China more than 1,000 years ago. Early paper money was simply a written promise to pay a certain amount of gold or silver money. The paper money was valuable because it could be traded for gold or silver. Later, governments began printing paper money. In the 1900s most governments made paper money valuable on its own. It no longer stood for gold or silver.</p>
