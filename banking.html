When you give your money to a bank, it’s called a deposit. Banks keep your money safe. And, more importantly, banks will pay you for every rupee you keep in a savings account! The money the bank pays you is called interest. The bank will pay you interest every month you keep the money in your savings account!

      </p>

      <p>       &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
Banks provide your money to other people. If you do not have enough money reserved to buy something, people usually borrow money from the bank. This is called a loan. Banks supply them the money to buy stuff, but the banks anticipate people to pay the money back and recompense the bank a little extra money, besides.

        Let’s say you borrowed ₹100 from a bank. You will get the ₹100 right away. But when you pay back the ₹100 back to the bank, the bank will charge you ₹10 or ₹20 extra for giving you the rupees when you needed it. So, you will in total pay the bank ₹110 or ₹120. That’s how the banks earn money.

            Without money from people like you, the banks wouldn’t have any money to give. That’s why banks will pay you interest. Imagine if your parents gave you ₹1,000 for your birthday every year for ten years. If you keep it in your parents safe, you’d have ₹10,000. But if you put it in a savings account, you might have ₹11,000 or even more. That’s is an extra ₹1,000, and you didn’t even have to do anything! That’s why it is better to open up a savings account!
