       <center><p class="about">It was my birthday a week ago. My parents had organized a birthday party for me. I was partying happily with my friends. My aunt came and gave me an envelope which was having some cash in it. I quickly went to my room and placed it on my reading table there and went outside to enjoy my birthday party. After some time when the party was over and I was unwrapping my gifts it stuck to my mind that I had kept envelope having cash in my room unattended. I rushed to my room but couldnâ€™t find it there. I was very worried. Luckily my two best friends who were still present at my home helped me in searching the envelope that had got misplaced and was lying under my reading table. There only we realized the importance of money and the idea of creating a website about money came into our mind.</p><br><img src="theteam.png" width="800" /><br>
       <p class="about">We friends worked together as a team to create this website. Everyone contributed equally and our IT teacher also guided us. Though we faced certain hurdles while working on this website but finally were able to accomplish our task on time. The main idea behind creating this website is to make kids aware about the role and importance of money. We worked very hard on our website and the results were upto the mark.</p>
